# About this Project 

## Background 

This project comes from a Hackathon that my friends and I did at Ryerson. The main idea of the hackathon was to get introduced to BlockChain and try to build something that 
can run on one of its many networks. 

## What did we do?

We chose to build a community of voters on a BlockChain network. One of the keys of blockchain is to eliminate a 'middle man'. In this case the middle man being eliminated 
was the law. It sounds crazy but hear me out. This network of voters are presented cases on a dispute case. The voters will then vote on what they think is right, and if 
their decision happens to be alligned with the majority of voters after the votes are counted, then they are rewarded in a crytocurrency known as CELL. This allows the 
economy to introduce new coins and incentivizes voting on this platform. The kicker is this COMMUNIFY (the company we've created) is a BACKEND. Meaning it has use cases in 
many fields. 

## So what are your use cases?

One of the most important use cases that COMMUNIFY can solve is Rideshare disputes. In the case of Uber, Lyft and other rideshare apps, if a dispute breaks out between 
rider and driver, they either have to take the litigation through court or they may decide to leave it all together. In the case of a dispute like wrong destination or 
improper compensation riders and drivers can provide screenshots of what went wrong. This is then sent to the COMMUNIFY blockchain network where the network can vote on who 
is right or wrong. The rider and driver do not even need to be together anymore, in fact they can split and expect full, some or no compensation if they are deemed to be 
the perpetrator. 


## Contract 

The contract you see in the repository, is the one I wrote. I tried to make a contract that solves a rider and driver dispute and is an example of how the blockchain can be 
used. Solidity seems to be JavaScript based and although I had no knowledge of jS and Blockchain I decided to take it on anyways in order to learn more. Needless to say I 
can see how important blockchain programmers could be in the future.
